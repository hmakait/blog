I'm doing my Master's degree in Computer Science at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de), where I focus 
on **large-scale data-processing** and **machine learning**. In my master thesis, I redesign message brokers to leverage 
remote direct memory access and persistent memory. Next to my studies I work as a student assistant at the
[Data Engineering Systems Group](https://hpi.de/rabl/home.html) at [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de) and 
previously as research assistant at the [Database Systems and Information Management Group](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de) 
at TU Berlin.

Before that, I was a **data scientist/engineer** at [Project A Ventures](https://www.project-a.com). Here, I worked with 
startups in very different stages for which we built **data pipelines** and **reporting infrastructures** for data warehouses
 and helped their data teams to be successful. During my most important project, we formed a small **cross-functional 
 on-site task-force** for three months analyzing the marketplace balance of a 500+MM USD online auction house and helped 
 to increase the revenue of the company and intelligently allocate marketing budgets.
 
I am interested in creating novel data processing systems or exploring the intersection of machine learning and data systems.
So if you are working in that space or have an interesting idea, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:hendrik.makait@gmail.com "hendrik.makait@gmail.com")!
